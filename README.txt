----------
Successfully completed all of the tasks and bonus.

The final submission skipped 1-, 2-, and 4-link IK and went straight to n-link IK.
Given that task A.2 and A.3 use the same OptimizerGD.cpp, I judged the alphaInitial value in code to discern between these 2 tasks, in order to get the expected outputs.
The highest stage completed is n-link IK with both BFGS and Newton's method.
The built-in OpenGl visualizer is also enabled, but to avoid lag you should run the program in release mode rather than the debug mode by default.
